                A website is a crucial part of a business's success in this day and age, especially if your 
                business isn't situated on a busy high street. And even if it is, that doesn't guarantee success. 
                More and more people are using the internet to search for desired products and services, simply 
                because it's so easy to just whip out one's mobile phone and do a quick Google search. So, why not 
                stack the odds in your favour with an eye-catching, professional website that has a great user 
                experience and brings the customers straight to you.

               A beautifully designed website can take months to put together, if 
               done from scratch. Fortunately, over the past decade, developers and teams from 
               all over the world have contributed massively to the developer community by 
               creating amazing packages, templates, 
               features, animations, designs, frameworks and so much more, for the purpose of 
               making it easier for all of us. 
               </p>
               <p class="profile-description text-left mb-2 mb-xl-4">
               This means, I don't have to reinvent the wheel. 
               The wheel has already been created. In fact, in my case, the wheel, the tyre, the suspension, 
               transmission, clutch, gears, you name it; has all been invented, packaged and made 
               available so that 
               I don't have to spend months and months on recreating that stuff. In many cases I don't even 
               need to put it all together, it's already been done for me. I come in when it comes time 
               to customise. To make the product unique and to make sure all the parts work together 
               efficiently and effectively. 
              </p>
              <p class="profile-description text-left mb-2 mb-xl-4">I take an already well designed website template (typically of 
               your choice) and custom fit it to your business and brand. I replace all he dummy content 
               with your business content. I change the layout of the template wherever and however 
               you desire. I change the primary and secondary colors to fit your business brand. I 
               change the fonts if desired and I add/adjust animations & effects to give your site 
               a fantastic user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="profile-description text-left">
              You can search for free or paid templates online to find the perfect one to use as a 
              foundation for your new business website. Simply go to Google (or any search engine) 
              and search for '<strong class="text-underline">Bootstrap</strong> templates for a business.' There are thousands of templates online 
              to download. Alternatively, you can click on one of the links below to see a few sites that 
              showcase some beautiful templates to download. Once you've found your one, you can either 
              download it (or just copy the link) and send it to me when you're sure that's the one. I'll 
              take that template along with 
              your content (business information, pictures, product/service information etc). We'll then spend some time 
              discussing exactly what you want and how you want it. Then I'll put it all together for you.
